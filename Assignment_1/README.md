## Problem Statement

Extend the hand-written compiler discussed in the tutorial so that it can translate
code segments generated by the following grammar:

stmt → id := expr

| if expr then stmt

| while expr do stmt

| begin opt_stmts end

opt_stmts → stmt_list |є

stmt_list → stmt_list; stmt | stmt

Also, modify the grammar for handling expressions so that it can handle relational
operators (=, <, >) as well as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). Try to generate x85 /
x86 assembly as the translated code.

Before doing the above assignment, draw an expression tree for the expression:

a + b * c + 4
